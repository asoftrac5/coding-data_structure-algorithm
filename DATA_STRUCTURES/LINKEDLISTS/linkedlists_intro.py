### Important Notes on Linked Lists

1. **Introduction to Linked Lists:**
   - Linked lists are a solution to problems associated with arrays and hash tables.
   - Two main types:
     - **Singly Linked Lists**: Nodes are connected in one direction.
     - **Doubly Linked Lists**: Nodes have references to both the next and previous nodes.

2. **Problems with Arrays:**
   - **Memory Allocation:** 
     - Static arrays require memory allocated next to each other, which is limited.
     - Dynamic arrays can resize but require O(n) operations to double memory in a new location.
   - **Insert/Delete Operations:**
     - Inserting/deleting at positions other than the end requires shifting indexes, which is inefficient.

3. **Hash Tables vs. Arrays:**
   - Hash tables overcome the memory allocation and ordering issues of arrays.
   - However, hash tables do not maintain **order**, which can be a drawback.

4. **Advantages of Linked Lists:**
   - Linked lists allow efficient **memory usage** without requiring contiguous memory allocation.
   - They maintain an **ordered structure** while enabling dynamic memory allocation.

5. **Trade-offs of Linked Lists:**
   - Linked lists are not universally superior to arrays or hash tables.
   - As with any data structure, their use depends on the specific problem and required operations.

6. **Linked Lists in Collision Resolution:**
   - Linked lists are commonly used in hash tables to handle **collisions**.
   - Example: In a hash table, when two keys hash to the same index, a linked list can store the colliding values.

7. **Upcoming Topics:**
   - Detailed exploration of singly and doubly linked lists.
   - Understanding their structure, operations, and performance trade-offs.

8. **Key Takeaway:**
   - Each data structure has its strengths and weaknesses. Linked lists address some limitations of arrays and hash tables but introduce their own trade-offs.
   - Choosing the right data structure depends on the specific requirements of the problem.
