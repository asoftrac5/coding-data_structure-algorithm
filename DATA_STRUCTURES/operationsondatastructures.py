### **Operations on Data Structures**  

#### **Overview**  
- Data structures are methods for organizing data on computers.  
- Each data structure has **trade-offs** and is optimized for specific operations.  
- Key operations performed on data structures:  

---

### **1. Insertion**  
- **Definition**: Adding a new data item to a collection.  
- Example: Adding an "Apple" item to memory.  

---

### **2. Deletion**  
- **Definition**: Removing an existing data item from a collection.  
- Example: Removing "Mango" from a list.  

---

### **3. Traversal**  
- **Definition**: Accessing each data item exactly once for processing.  
- Common in operations like iterating through lists or trees.  

---

### **4. Searching**  
- **Definition**: Locating the position of a specific data item within a collection.  
- Determines if the item exists in the data structure.  

---

### **5. Sorting**  
- **Definition**: Arranging data in a specific order (e.g., ascending or descending).  
- Sorted data is often easier to search and process.  

---

### **6. Access**  
- **Definition**: Retrieving a data item from the collection.  
- **Importance**: A fundamental operation used frequently in programming.  

---

### **Performance and Big-O Notation**  
- **Big-O Analysis**: Helps evaluate the efficiency of operations (e.g., insertion, deletion) for each data structure.  
- Data structures have different **average** and **worst-case** complexities for these operations.  
- Trees and tree variants dominate many data structure types and will be covered in detail.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
- Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of data structures allows you to choose the optimal structure for a problem.  
- The course will cover these operations and their implications in detail for various data structures.
