### Important Notes:

1. **String Questions as Array Questions**:
   - In interviews, treat string manipulation problems as array manipulation problems.
   - Strings can be viewed as arrays of characters.

2. **Common Approach**:
   - Convert strings into arrays using methods like `split` (in JavaScript) for easier manipulation.
   - Perform operations such as loops or transformations on the array.
   - Convert the array back into a string after completing the operations.

3. **Example Question**:
   - For tasks like reversing a string, think of splitting it into an array, performing the reverse operation, and then joining it back into a string.

4. **Practice Example**:
   - A demonstration of this technique will follow in the next video with a common interview question.

5. **Key Tip**:
   - Always remember this trick when faced with string manipulation problems in interviews. It simplifies the process.
