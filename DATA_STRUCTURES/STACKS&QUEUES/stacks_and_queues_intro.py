### Notes on Stacks and Queues

1. **Introduction**:  
   - **Stacks** and **Queues** are **linear data structures**, meaning elements are traversed sequentially, one by one.  
   - Only one element can be directly accessed at a time.

2. **Key Similarities**:  
   - Both are built on underlying data structures like arrays or linked lists.  
   - They provide limited operations such as:
     - **Push**: Add an element.  
     - **Peek**: View the element at the top/front without removing it.  
     - **Pop**: Remove an element.  
   - **No Random Access**:  
     - Unlike arrays, you cannot access elements arbitrarily.

3. **Key Difference**:  
   - The order in which elements are removed:  
     - **Stacks**: Follows **LIFO (Last In, First Out)**.  
     - **Queues**: Follows **FIFO (First In, First Out)**.

4. **Advantages of Limited Operations**:  
   - Simplifies use cases and ensures efficient and controlled access.  
   - Prevents misuse by limiting the types of operations allowed.  
   - Useful in scenarios where strict control over data flow is needed.

5. **Use Cases**:  
   - **Stacks**:  
     - Function call management in programming (call stack).  
     - Undo operations in applications.  
     - Expression evaluation and syntax parsing.  
   - **Queues**:  
     - Task scheduling (e.g., print queues, process scheduling).  
     - Breadth-first search in graphs.  
     - Real-world systems like ticket lines or customer service systems.

6. **Implementation**:  
   - Can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.  
   - Higher-level abstractions built over lower-level data structures provide specialized functionality with limited operations.

7. **Key Takeaway**:  
   - Stacks and queues are specialized tools in computer science, enabling efficient, controlled operations in specific contexts.  
   - Their simplicity and operation constraints make them foundational data structures.  

8. **Next Steps**:  
   - Learn detailed functionality and behavior of stacks and queues.  
   - Implement custom versions of these data structures to understand their mechanics.
