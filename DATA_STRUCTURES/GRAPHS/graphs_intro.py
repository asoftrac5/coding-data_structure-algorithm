### Notes: Introduction to Graphs  

1. **Definition**:
   - A graph is a **data structure** representing a set of values connected in a **pairwise fashion**.
   - Consists of:
     - **Nodes (Vertices)**: Represent the entities in the graph.
     - **Edges**: Represent the connections or relationships between nodes.

2. **Applications**:
   - Graphs are ideal for modeling **real-world relationships**.
   - Examples include:
     - **Social Networks** (e.g., Facebook friendships).
     - **Recommendation Engines** (e.g., Amazon).
     - **Mapping Systems** (e.g., Google Maps for shortest paths).
     - **Networks**: Roads, internet, or family trees.

3. **Characteristics**:
   - Graphs can represent various structures like:
     - **Linked Lists** (a linear graph).
     - **Trees** (a type of hierarchical graph).
   - All **trees** and **linked lists** are types of graphs.

4. **Examples**:
   - Simple and complex networks, from family trees to road maps, are all **graphs**.

5. **Versatility**:
   - Graphs are among the **most useful and widely used** data structures in computer science.

6. **Next Steps**:
   - Detailed learning of graph concepts in the upcoming sessions.
