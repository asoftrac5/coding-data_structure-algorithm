### **Important Notes: Binary Search**

#### **Definition & Purpose**
- **Binary Search**: A search algorithm for sorted lists, enabling efficient lookup by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.
- **Key Idea**: Instead of checking elements one by one (like in linear search), binary search discards half of the elements at each step.

---

#### **How Binary Search Works**
1. **Prerequisite**: The list must be sorted.
2. **Steps**:
   - Start by comparing the middle element of the list with the target.
   - Decide:
     - If the target is smaller, discard the right half.
     - If the target is larger, discard the left half.
   - Repeat the process with the remaining half until the target is found or the search space is empty.
3. **Efficiency**:
   - Significantly fewer operations compared to linear search.
   - Example:
     - Searching for `34` in a sorted list involves:
       - Compare with middle â†’ Discard half.
       - Repeat until found in just a few steps.

#### **Advantages of Binary Search**
1. **Time Complexity**: \( O(\log n) \)
   - Much faster than linear search (\( O(n) \)), especially for large datasets.
   - Efficient for tasks where data is pre-sorted or stored in a sorted structure like a binary search tree.
2. **Divide and Conquer Approach**:
   - Reduces the problem size with each step, halving the search space.
3. **Comparison with Linear Search**:
   - Linear Search: Checks one element at a time (\( O(n) \)).
   - Binary Search: Skips half the elements at each step (\( O(\log n) \)).

#### **Binary Search in Practice**
1. **Example**: Finding a name in a sorted phonebook:
   - Start with the middle page, decide which half to explore next.
   - Repeat until the desired name is found.
2. **Applications**:
   - Searching in sorted arrays.
   - Lookups in binary search trees (BST).

---

#### **Binary Search vs. Tree Traversal**
1. **Binary Search**:
   - Focuses on finding a specific item efficiently in a sorted list or tree.
   - Doesn't visit all nodes.
2. **Traversal**:
   - Ensures all nodes are visited.
   - Use cases:
     - Updating attributes of all nodes.
     - Applying transformations (e.g., doubling values).
   - Introduced as a next topic.

---

#### **Key Concepts to Remember**
- Binary Search **requires sorted data**.
- The divide and conquer approach drastically reduces the number of comparisons.
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(\log n) \), ideal for large datasets.
- Useful for scenarios where fast lookups are critical, such as in binary search trees, sorted arrays, or databases.

**Next Steps**: Traversal techniques to visit all nodes systematically.
