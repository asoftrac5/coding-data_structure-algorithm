# Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms (Python)

## Overview

Welcome to my repository for the **Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms** Udemy course by [Andrei Neagoie](https://zerotomastery.io/). This repository includes my Python implementations, notes, and solutions to coding challenges. The goal is to enhance my problem-solving skills, prepare for coding interviews, and strengthen my understanding of data structures and algorithms.


## Contents

- **Course Notes:**  
Detailed explanations, pseudocode, and insights into various algorithms and data structures.  

- **Code Implementations:**  
  Python implementations for topics such as:
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists
  - Hash Tables
  - Trees
  - Graphs
  - Sorting Algorithms
  - Dynamic Programming  

- **Practice Problems:**  
Solutions to practice problems and coding challenges are provided in the course.  


## Getting Started
